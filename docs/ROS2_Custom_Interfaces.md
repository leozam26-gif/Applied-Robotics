# (A3) Activity 3: ROS 2 Custom Interfaces

## Overview

This activity extends the services workflow by introducing **custom ROS 2 interfaces** (one `.msg` and one `.srv`) and integrating them into a two-node system:

- A **Battery node** simulates the battery level and acts as a **service client**.
- An **LED panel node** exposes a **service server** (`/set_led`) and publishes the LED panel state on a topic (`/led_panel_state`).

Conceptually, the goal is to use a service request to **toggle an LED** depending on battery state: when the battery becomes empty, an LED is powered **ON**, and when it becomes full again, it is powered **OFF**.

## System Architecture

**Nodes**

1. `Battery_node`  
    - Service **client** for: `/set_led`

2. `LED_panel_node`  
    - Service **server** for: `/set_led`
    - Topic **publisher** for: `/led_panel_state`

**Interfaces**

- Custom service: `LEDpanel.srv` (used by `/set_led`)
- Custom message: `BatStatus.msg` (used by `/led_panel_state`)

---

## Custom Interfaces

Before implementing the nodes, a dedicated interfaces package (in this case, `er_interfaces`) is used to define and build the custom service and message types.

### Service definition: `LEDpanel.srv`

The service definition is designed to represent a **3-LED panel** through three boolean request fields and a single boolean response field:

- **Request**
  - `lbit1` (bool): LED 1 command
  - `lbit2` (bool): LED 2 command
  - `lbit3` (bool): LED 3 command
- **Response**
  - `success` (bool): confirms whether the request was processed correctly

Is important to consider that request/response field names were written using lowercase letters and without symbols to avoid build/compilation issues in the ROS 2 interface generation pipeline.

```bash
bool lbit1
bool lbit2
bool lbit3
---
bool success
```
### Message definition: `BatStatus.msg`

The LED panel state is published as a custom message with three `int8` fields:

- `led1` (int8): LED 1 state (0/1)
- `led2` (int8): LED 2 state (0/1)
- `led3` (int8): LED 3 state (0/1)

```bash
int8 led1
int8 led2
int8 led3
```

This representation is intentionally minimal: each LED state is expressed as a numeric bit (0 = OFF, 1 = ON).


Finally, to generate and use these interfaces, the `.msg` and `.srv` paths must be registered in the interface generation section (`rosidl_generate_interfaces(...)`) in `CMakeLists.txt`.

```bash
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "msg/BatStatus.msg"
  "srv/LEDpanel.srv"
  #Remaining file paths
)
```

---

## Node 1 — LED Panel Node (Service Server + State Publisher)

The `LED_panel_node` is responsible for two roles:

1. Hosting the `/set_led` **service server** (custom type `LEDpanel`)
2. Publishing the LED panel state on the `/led_panel_state` **topic** (custom type `BatStatus`)

Also, instead of publishing panel state continuously with a timer, this node publishes only when there is a **meaningful change** (when a service request arrives). This avoids sending redundant messages and keeps the topic output focused on actual state transitions.


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from er_interfaces.srv import LEDpanel
from er_interfaces.msg import BatStatus

class MyPanel(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("LED_panel_node") #Only identification

        self.server = self.create_service(LEDpanel,"set_led", self.set_status)
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(BatStatus, "led_panel_state", 10)

        self.get_logger().info("LEDs Panel ready")

    def set_status(self, request: LEDpanel.Request, response: LEDpanel.Response):
        msg = BatStatus()

        if (request.lbit3):
            msg.led3 = 1
        else:
            msg.led3 = 0

        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f"{msg.led1} | {msg.led2} | {msg.led3}")

        response.success = True
        return response

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)   
    LED_panel_node = MyPanel()
    rclpy.spin(LED_panel_node) 
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    main()
```

### Service callback behavior (`set_status`)

When the service receives a request:

- A `BatStatus` message is created.
- The requested LED bit is translated into a `0/1` value in the corresponding `msg.ledX` field.
- The message is published to `/led_panel_state`.
- A logger prints a simple “panel visualization” in the terminal (useful as a lightweight debugger).
- `response.success` is set to `True` and returned to the client.

For simplicity, the callback only evaluates `request.lbit3`, meaning the logic toggles only the **least significant bit** (LED 3). LEDs 1 and 2 remain available in the interface design but are not used in the current implementation.

---

## Node 2 — Battery Node (Service Client + Battery Simulation)

The `Battery_node` simulates battery life and triggers LED changes by calling the `/set_led` service.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from er_interfaces.srv import LEDpanel
from functools import partial

class MyBat(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Battery_node") #Only identification          
        self.client = self.create_client(LEDpanel,"set_led") #Service type, Service name
        
        self.level = 100
        self.create_timer(0.1, self.bat_level)

    def call_status_alert(self, lbit3: bool):
        while not self.client.wait_for_service(timeout_sec = 1.0):
            self.get_logger().info("Server not available")

        request = LEDpanel.Request()
        request.lbit3 = lbit3

        self.future = self.client.call_async(request)   #asyncronous request
        self.future.add_done_callback(partial(self.add_status_alert, request))

    def add_status_alert(self, request: LEDpanel.Request, future):
        response = future.result()
        self.get_logger().info(f"S: {response.success}, lbit3={request.lbit3}")
        
    def bat_level(self):
        self.level -= 1
        if (self.level == 60):
            self.call_status_alert(False)
        elif (self.level == 0): 
            self.level = 100
            self.call_status_alert(True)
        

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)   
    Battery_node = MyBat()
    rclpy.spin(Battery_node) 
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    main()
```

### Service-call workflow (`call_status_alert` + `add_status_alert`)

- **Wait for server:** `call_status_alert()` uses `wait_for_service()` to ensure `/set_led` is available (prints a message if not).
- **Build request:** creates `LEDpanel.Request()` and assigns `request.lbit3` from the input boolean (`True` = ON, `False` = OFF).
- **Send asynchronously:** calls `call_async(request)` so the node keeps running while the request is processed.
- **Handle response:** `add_status_alert()` retrieves `future.result()` and logs `success` plus the requested `lbit3` value for verification.

### Battery simulation approach

A timer runs every **100 ms** (0.1 s) and executes a battery update function:

- `self.level` starts at 100
- Each timer tick decrements the level by 1
- When specific thresholds are reached, the node sends a service request to the LED panel

This timer-driven logic emulates a battery discharge/charge cycle without requiring real sensor input. The thresholds act as “events” that trigger service calls. The battery node sends requests using an **asynchronous** service call (`call_async`). When the service returns a response the callback prints confirmation info (`success`) along with the request bit that was sent (`lbit3`), allowing quick validation that the interaction worked as expected.
